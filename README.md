# Stroke-prediction
 Jupyter notebook with EDA and ML models for stroke prediction.<br/>
The notebook is available in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/mauronavarra/stroke-prediction-dataset-eda-ml-classification/notebook">Kaggle</a> (github doesn't correctly render the interactive plots from the plotly library).
